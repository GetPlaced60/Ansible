## Introduction

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the process of configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Ansible uses YAML-based playbooks to define automation jobs, which can be executed on remote servers via SSH.

## Installation

To install Ansible, use the following steps:

### On Ubuntu/Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
```

### On CentOS/RHEL

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install ansible
```

## Key Concepts

- **Inventory**: A file containing a list of servers where Ansible will run tasks.
- **Playbook**: A YAML file containing a series of tasks to be executed on remote servers.
- **Module**: A unit of code that Ansible runs on each host. Modules can manage files, packages, services, and more.
- **Task**: A single action to be performed on the remote server.
- **Role**: A way to organize playbooks and other files into reusable units.

## Common Commands

### Running Ad-Hoc Commands

Ad-hoc commands are useful for quick tasks. Here are some common examples:

- **Ping all servers in inventory:**

  ```bash
  ansible all -m ping
  ```

- **Check disk space on all servers:**

  ```bash
  ansible all -m shell -a 'df -h'
  ```

- **Copy a file to all servers:**

  ```bash
  ansible all -m copy -a 'src=/local/path dest=/remote/path'
  ```

### Managing Playbooks

- **Run a playbook:**

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml
  ```

- **Check playbook syntax:**

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --syntax-check
  ```

- **Dry run (check mode):**

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
  ```

- **Run a specific tag in a playbook:**

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "tag_name"
  ```

## Modules

Ansible comes with a wide range of built-in modules. Here are some common ones:

- **File module**: Manage files and directories.

  ```yaml
  - name: Create a directory
    file:
      path: /path/to/directory
      state: directory
  ```

- **User module**: Manage user accounts.

  ```yaml
  - name: Create a user
    user:
      name: username
      state: present
  ```

- **Package module**: Manage packages.

  ```yaml
  - name: Install a package
    apt:
      name: package_name
      state: present
  ```

## Playbooks

Playbooks are the heart of Ansible automation. Here's a simple example:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure web server is installed
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using Roles

Roles allow you to group tasks, handlers, and variables. Here's how to create and use a role:

1. Create the role directory structure:

   ```bash
   ansible-galaxy init myrole
   ```

2. Use the role in a playbook:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - hosts: all
     roles:
       - myrole
   ```

### Variables and Facts

- **Defining variables:**

  ```yaml
  vars:
    http_port: 80
  ```

- **Using variables:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Ensure Nginx is listening on the correct port
    lineinfile:
      path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
      regexp: 'listen .*'
      line: "listen {{ http_port }};"
  ```

- **Gathering facts:**

  ```yaml
  - name: Gather facts
    setup:
  ```

## Best Practices

- Use version control for playbooks.
- Organize playbooks and roles logically.
- Test playbooks in a staging environment.
- Use ansible-lint to check for common issues.

## Troubleshooting

- **Verbose output:**

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook playbook.yml -v  # -vvv for more verbosity
  ```

- **Check module documentation:**

  ```bash
  ansible-doc <module_name>
  ```
